# Hi, I'm Mehdi Baneshi

I am a **Senior Software Developer** with a deep passion for building scalable systems and constantly learning new technologies. My interests span from **systems architecture** to **compiler design**, and I‚Äôm actively exploring exciting areas like **Rust**, **WebAssembly**, and **AI-driven automation**. This repository serves as a showcase of my work, projects, and tools I use in my everyday workflow.

I am **stack-agnostic** and love experimenting with different tools, choosing the ones that best align with my drive for efficiency. I‚Äôm passionate about **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **design patterns**‚Äîa true computer science nerd with a love for both low-level performance and high-level problem-solving.

Recently, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into **AI**, **automation**, and scaling my skills across new domains. From **system design** to **distributed systems** and **product UX**, I aim to craft scalable, maintainable, and extensible software solutions.

I believe in hands-on exploration: whether it‚Äôs **Java**, **Python**, **Kotlin**, or **Swift**, or dabbling in **Flutter** or **React Native** for mobile development. No matter the tech stack, I‚Äôm up for the challenge and enjoy the learning journey.
