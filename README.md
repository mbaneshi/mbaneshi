# Hi, I'm Mehdi Baneshi 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Developer & AI Integrator**, working as an **independent contractor** and **remote-first developer**. I help startups and growing teams build scalable applications — faster — by combining modern tech stacks with intelligent automation.

With over 8 years of experience, I specialize in **leading small teams**, **mentoring junior developers**, and **architecting full-stack systems** that are maintainable, efficient, and ready for growth.

I’m currently focused on:
- Building AI-powered workflows using **LangChain, PydanticAI, and n8n**
- Developing robust backends with **Python, FastAPI, Django, and Node.js**
- Crafting responsive frontends with **React, React Native, and TypeScript**
- Containerizing and deploying with **Docker, Docker Compose, and cloud platforms**
- Leveraging **Supabase, PostgreSQL, and real-time data** for modern apps

I use AI **daily** — not just for code suggestions, but for **system design, debugging, documentation, and automation**. I believe the future of development is **agentic coding**, and I'm already living it.
