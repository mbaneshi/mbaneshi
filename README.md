## üî≠ Current Projects

### 1. [Project Name](https://github.com/username/project)
A brief description of this project, what it's aimed to achieve, and the technologies being used.

# Porting Automation with Rust & WebAssembly

Welcome to my repository, where I document my journey in automating codebase porting to **Rust** and **WebAssembly**, with a focus on the [TON Blockchain](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton). Leveraging AI, code analyzers, and web automation tools, I aim to streamline the process of adapting existing codebases for modern environments.

## üîß Current Research & Workflow Design

I'm currently in the **research phase**, gathering the most suitable tools and designing an efficient workflow to automate this process.

### Goals
- Automate the porting of codebases to **Rust** and **Wasm**.
- Build agentic tools powered by **LLMs** for code analysis and social media interaction automation.
- Utilize AI models from HuggingFace to streamline content generation and workflow decisions.

## üõ† Tech Stack & Tools

### Automation & AI
- **HuggingFace Models**: For code understanding, natural language processing, and automation.
- **Playwright & Chrome Extensions**: For web interaction and testing.
- **LLMs (Language Models)**: To power AI-driven decisions and generate content automatically.

### Backend & Dashboard
- **FastAPI**: For backend services to monitor and manage the porting process.
- **Streamlit**: For visualizing progress and creating interactive dashboards.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the main database to store logs, progress, and automation metadata.

## üöÄ Current Projects

### 1. Porting TON Blockchain to Rust/Wasm
The core project focuses on converting the [TON Blockchain](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton) codebase into **Rust** and **WebAssembly**, utilizing AI for automation.

### 2. Web Interaction Automation
Building an admin dashboard with **FastAPI** and **Streamlit**, I automate the interaction process with **Playwright** and custom **Chrome extensions**.

### 3. Social Media Automation with LLMs
Exploring **HuggingFace** models to create automated tools for content generation, social media management, and interaction, with the goal of building a small business around AI-driven social automation.
